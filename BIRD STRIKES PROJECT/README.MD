#Overview
Welcome to my Bird Strike Data Analysis project. This project aims to analyze and understand bird strike incidents reported by the FAA from 2000 to 2011. Bird strikes present a significant threat to aircraft safety, especially during critical phases of flight such as take-off and landing. This analysis seeks to explore the occurrence patterns, environmental factors, and potential safety risks caused by these incidents.

The dataset, provided by the FAA, includes detailed information on bird strike events, including incident dates, phases of flight, types of aircraft, and affected components. Through a series of Python scripts and visualizations, this project aims to uncover trends and offer insights to enhance aviation safety by mitigating the risks posed by bird strikes.

The Questions
Below are the key questions that this project aims to answer:

Which types of aircraft are most affected by bird strikes?
During which phases of flight do bird strikes occur most frequently?
What are the environmental factors (time of day, location, season) that increase bird strike risks?
Which aircraft components are most vulnerable to bird strikes?
How has the frequency of bird strikes changed between 2000 and 2011?
What are the safety recommendations that can be derived from the analysis?
